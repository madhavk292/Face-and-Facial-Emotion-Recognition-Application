# Face-and-Facial-Emotion-Recognition-Application
Trained a model that identifies the person in image along with the expression on their face.
Tools/Technologies used: Python, Django, TensorFlow, OpenCV.

## Project Phase - 1 : Face Recognition and Person Identity
- Gather Images
- Extract Faces only from Images
- Labeling (Target output) Images
- Data Preprocessing
- Training Face Recognition with OWN Machine Learning Models.
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machines
  - Random Forest Classifier
- Combine All Machine Learning Models using **Ensemble Technique** with **Voting Classifier** 
- Tuning Machine Learning Model
- Model Evaluation
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - Sensitivity
  - Specificity
  - F1 Score
  - Accuracy
## Project Phase - 2: Train Facial Emotion Recognition
- Gather Emotion Images
- Data Preprocessing
- Train Machine Learning Models with OWN Machine Learning Models.
